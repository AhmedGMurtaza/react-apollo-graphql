## React Apollo GraphQL [from scratch]


Today you have basically two ways how to start new React application: [NextJs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) or [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

This application was created from scratch. If you ever wondered how to create your own boilerplate. This is a good place to start.
